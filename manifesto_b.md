##we are thinkers and doers
discoverers and explorers

we navigate the choppy seas  
of ambiguity and uncertainty  
in a joyful, fearless flurry

our minds are restlessly roving  
our hands continuously crafting  
our hearts steadfast in our intent

a hunger to understand  
and an instinct to build

why do we do what we do?

because every one of our users is  
a living, breathing human being  
with desires, dreams, fears, needs  
who spends a quarter of their life  
working with the products we build

when we build crappy products				
we create waste, frustration, anger [^1]

when we build great products  
we create efficiency, productivity, delight [^2]

we have the opportunity  
through inclusive design  
to change the lives of our users

and since we build the systems  
that power the world  
for 100 years and counting

design at IBM is not  
“a nice thing to have” or  
“let’s make this look pretty”

design at IBM is  
an irrefutable responsibility

this is why  
we make and remake  
a thousand times over  
for millions of human beings		

with one purpose:  
to be irrefutably essential  
to our users, IBM and the world
